# Hyperbolic Discrete Diffusion Model for 3D RNA Inverse Folding

## ðŸ”¬ About RIdiffusion

**RIdiffusion** is a hyperbolic discrete diffusion model designed for **3D RNA inverse folding**. Unlike traditional RNA design models that primarily focus on secondary structures, RIdiffusion integrates **geometric deep learning** and **hyperbolic embedding** to efficiently generate RNA sequences that fold into complex 3D structures.

### Key Features:

- **Hyperbolic Space Representation**: Captures intricate RNA 3D structures more effectively than Euclidean methods.
- **Discrete Diffusion Process**: Enhances sequence recovery accuracy for inverse folding.
- **Generative Model**: Outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in **low-data** scenarios.
- **Optimized for Functional RNA Design**: Enables novel sequence generation for biotechnological and biomedical applications.

This repository provides a demo script to set up the environment, preprocess datasets, and run RIdiffusion for generating RNA sequences based on RNA 3D backbone.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset and Preprocessing

### 1. Download Dataset

Move to the dataset source folder:

```bash
cd ./dataset_src/
```

Download the dataset from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LXayUQP24WGxrbPABEwVvMgINCHYUM_D/view?usp=sharing) and place it in `./dataset_src/`.

### 2. Extract Dataset

```bash
tar -zxvf preprocessed_dataset.tar.gz
```

### 3. Generate Graph Data

Run the following command to generate **graph files**, which will be stored in `graph_dataset/`:

```bash
cd ..
python generate_graph_ss.py
```

------

## ðŸŽ¯ Running the Experiments

To generate RNA sequences based on **PDB structures** in `./pdb/`, run:

```bash
python seq_generator.py
```

This will generate structured sequence outputs as described in the original manuscript.
